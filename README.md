The run_analysis.R script runs all the five requirements of the course project:

1. It reads in the txt files, assign them column names and then merges them into a single table.

2. It extracts the mean and standard deviation from the said table.

3. It gives the table descriptive names of the activity.

4. The variable names are descriptive too.

5. A second table is produced, which shows the average of each variables and subject.
