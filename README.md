This repo contains the final course project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning data

run_analysis.R holds the codes used to tidy up the data. It does that in five steps, as described in it.

Codebook.md justifies the steps taken in the codes vis-a-vis the project objectives.

The output of the codes are attached here as tidydata.txt.
